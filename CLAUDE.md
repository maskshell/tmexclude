# tmexclude — Project Instructions

## Repository Topology

- `origin` = `maskshell/tmexclude` (this fork; push target for all branches)
- `upstream` = `PhotonQuantum/tmexclude` (authoritative source of development)

## Branch Strategy

Development happens directly on the fork's `master`.

### `master` (development branch)

- Fork `master` = `upstream/master` + local development commits (environment settings, local patches, project docs including this file).
- Sync from upstream: `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master`, then `git push --force-with-lease origin master`. Local commits replay on top of the new upstream tip.
- Keep commits self-contained so individual commits can be cherry-picked later.
- Never open PRs from `master` (it contains local-only commits).
- Never push to or rewrite `upstream`.

### PR branches

- Create only when a PR is wanted. Branch fresh from `upstream/master` (not from fork `master`).
- Populate by cherry-picking the needed commits from fork `master`.
- Naming: `pr/<topic>` (e.g. `pr/rule-patterns`).
- Push the PR branch to `origin`; open the PR against `upstream`.

## Local-Only Files

- Environment files (`.cgcignore`, `.env.solidforge`, similar) stay untracked via `.git/info/exclude` plus the Solid Forge managed entries in the tracked `.gitignore` (`.env`, `.env.solidforge`, ... — ignore rules only, never commit the actual files).
- `.env.solidforge.example` is a tracked placeholder; do commit it.

## Build / Test

- Rust crate root: `src-tauri/`.
- Run unit tests: `cargo test --lib` from `src-tauri/` (integration test in `tests/` is fully commented out; building the binary requires the frontend `dist/`).
- ts-rs regenerates TypeScript bindings (`src/bindings/`) during `cargo test`. Include regenerated binding files in any commit that changes exported types.
## L1 Constitution (uncodable red lines)

Red lines that cannot be encoded as deterministic architecture-contract rules live here. These are Blockers: a violation returns the work for rewrite. Codable red lines (circular dependencies, layer isolation, concurrency baselines) are enforced deterministically by the inner Architecture-Contract Gate — do not duplicate them here; declare them in the project's arch-contract config (.importlinter.ini / .dependency-cruiser.cjs / .swiftlint.yml).

- Abstraction level must be appropriate: a helper must not leak domain logic into a generic utility, and a high-level policy must not reach into a low-level primitive directly.
- Naming must reflect intent, not implementation accident. A name that contradicts what the code does is a Blocker.
- No emergent coupling: two modules that are not explicitly wired must not secretly depend on each other's internal behavior or ordering.
- No "delete the error" fixes: removing a failing module, hardcoding a value to turn a test green, or wrapping logic in a bare catch to silence a failure are Blockers (the fast gate + blueprint diff catch most of these).
- All authentication/authorization that cannot be statically proven to flow through the unified gateway is a Blocker.

When a Reviewer flags one of these, the convergence loop treats it as an outer- ring Blocker and returns the change for rewrite — not a Warning.

## Deterministic Gate Toolchain

The convergence-loop gates degrade gracefully and never report a silent green when a tool is absent. To arm them on a new machine or in CI, restore/install the gate tools for the ecosystems this project uses:

Project-local installs (node_modules/.bin, the local venv bins) count as present only under their opt-ins — SF_PROJECT_NODE_BIN=1 / SF_PROJECT_VENV_TOOLS=1 (PATH always wins; the arm report and gate coverage notes state what the gates can actually execute).

- Web: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` — dependency-cruiser / eslint are in devDependencies
- Rust (per-machine, NOT in the repo): `rustup component add clippy rustfmt` (optional `cargo install cargo-modules`); coverage gate `cargo install cargo-tarpaulin`
